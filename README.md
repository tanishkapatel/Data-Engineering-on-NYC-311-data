## Technologies used:
- Apache Airflow for ETL Pipeline generation 
- Apache Spark (PySpark, Spark SQL) and Pandas for processing and transforming data
- pyspark.ml library used for the resolution time prediction 
- Tableau used for Data Visualization 
- HTML, CSS, Flask used for creating the front end
